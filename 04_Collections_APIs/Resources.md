####Array of Hashes

```ruby
	super_heros =[{ hero: 'Batman', secret_identity: 'Bruce Wayne'}, 
	{hero: 'Superman', secret_identity: 'Clark Kent'}, 
	{hero: 'Spiderman', secret_identity: 'Peter Parker'}]
```


####.each & .map

```ruby
	super_heros.map do |super_hero| 
		puts "#{super_hero[:hero]} is #{super_hero[:secret_identity]}"
	end
```
	
```ruby
	super_heros.each do |super_hero| 
		puts "#{super_hero[:hero]} is #{super_hero[:secret_identity]}"
	end
```
